# Artificial Intelligence Basis :brain:
The repository is a set of basic problems related to artificial intelligence


### Task :one:
Implements Gradient Descent method and Newton’s method 
for function minimalization.

### Task :two:
Implementation of generic algorithm responsible for the analysis of multidimensional quadratic function.
The algorithm uses:
* Roulette-shell selection with scaling.
* Single point crossover.
* FIFO replacement strategy.

### Task :three:
Tic tac toe game using min-max with alpha-beta pruning algorithm.

### Task :four:
A program that predicts whether a packet is a DDoS attack packet or a normal packet.
The training process contains hyperparameter optimization.

### Task :five:
Implementation of an N-layer perceptron for classification of flowers (Irises)

### Task :six:
Set up an environment using an open AI gym for ‘CarRacing-v0'. Then choose an algorithm and train the model with varying policies and compare obtained results.

### Task :seven:
Design a Bayesian network.
