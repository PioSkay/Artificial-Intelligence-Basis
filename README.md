# Artificial Intelligence Basis :brain:
The repository is a set of basic problems related to artificial intelligence


### Task :one:
Implements Gradient Descent method and Newtonâ€™s method 
for function minimalization.

### Task :two:
Implementation of generic algorithm responsible for the analysis of multidimensional quadratic function.
The algorithm uses:
* Roulette-shell selection with scaling.
* Single point crossover.
* FIFO replacement strategy.

### Task :three:
Tic tac toe game using min-max with alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
